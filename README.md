## Testing Releases

Just a test repo for me to test releases on.

The main conventions explored here are:

- Convention commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Dangerfile (https://danger.systems/python/)
- Semantic Release (https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or https://github.com/cycjimmy/semantic-release-action)
